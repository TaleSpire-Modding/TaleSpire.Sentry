# Automation Dll's (WIP)

This is a private repo aimed to allow the use of GitHub Actions to build talespire plugin projects and deploy them to thunderstore.
Due to legal reasons the dlls can't be re-distributed publicly so a pipeline is being built to retrieve these dlls privately using secrets.
A public Github Action will be supplied to allow anyone to automate their builds aswell. 
They will have to provide their own dll's in a private repository as well.
